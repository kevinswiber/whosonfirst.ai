/**
 * Glossary terms, linked where they are used.
 *
 * `inline()` and `block()` in md.ts take a Gloss. With one, the first time a
 * glossary term appears in the text they are given, it becomes a link to its
 * entry that carries the definition with it. A script in the base layout shows
 * that definition in place on hover or focus. Activating the link always goes
 * to the glossary, with or without the script.
 *
 * "The first time" is counted by the Gloss, so whoever renders a piece of the
 * page decides what one reading of it is: a flow page's own text shares one, and
 * each step of its diagram has its own, because steps are read one at a time.
