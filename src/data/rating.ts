/**
 * The rating rule, kept free of site data so it can be checked on its own
 * (scripts/rating-check.mjs). The rule is stated for readers on the About page
 * under "How flows are rated".
 *
 *   - A flow takes the level of its least mature required reference.
 *   - Optional and background references never change it.
 *   - A reference whose role is not settled is not counted, and is not assumed
 *     to be optional or stable either. If requiring it would lower the level,
 *     the rating is provisional until the reference is classified.
