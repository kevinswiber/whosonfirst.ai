/**
 * "What can the API verify?" — one user, one agent, one API, and two credentials
 * the agent might present. Used by the full comparison on the Concepts page
 * (VerifyDetail).
 *
 * Five things are kept apart here, because a credential can settle one without
 * settling the others:
 *   1. who the credential was issued to            (check: software)
 *   2. whose authority it represents               (check: user)
 *   3. what permissions it conveys                 (check: grant)
 *   4. proof that the presenter is that holder     (check: sender; detail only)
 *   5. whether access can be refused or revoked    (`stop`; not a verification)
 *      Three things stay separate there: the API's own access policy, revocation
 *      at the authorization server, and how the API learns of a revocation.
 *
 * The token is one specific example: a JWT access token following RFC 9068,
 * shown abbreviated. Not every token or introspection response carries these
 * fields; `exampleToken` says so on the Concepts page.
 *
 * `brief` is the few words shown beside a verdict in the compact version;
 * `detail` is the full explanation. A verdict only holds under the condition
 * in the credential's `reads`, which the compact version shows beside it.
