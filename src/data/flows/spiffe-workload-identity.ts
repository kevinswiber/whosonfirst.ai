    "Every agent process gets a cryptographic identity from the infrastructure it runs on, and uses it to authenticate both ends of every connection.",
  summary: `SPIFFE is a set of open specifications for giving software an identity without giving it a secret. Each workload gets a name, a SPIFFE ID such as \`spiffe://example.org/ns/agents/sa/research-agent\`, and a short-lived credential that proves the name: an X.509 certificate or a JWT, called an SVID.

The workload does not log in to get it. It asks a local agent over a Unix socket, and the local agent works out who is asking by inspecting the calling process: which pod, which service account, which container image. Identity is derived from what the workload *is*, checked by something outside it.

For agent systems this gives you a per-workload identity that works the same across clusters and clouds. The certificate authenticates the workload to its peer and renews automatically. Service meshes use the same identities under the hood.`,
  fits: [
    "Agent-to-tool and agent-to-agent calls inside your own infrastructure.",
    "Multi-cluster or multi-cloud deployments that need one identity scheme.",
    "A foundation for other flows. An SVID can authenticate an OAuth client where the authorization server supports it. A JWT-SVID can be exchanged for another token by a service configured to accept it. An X.509-SVID can supply the certificate for [OAuth mTLS token binding](/flows/oauth-mtls/) where both servers support it.",
  ],
  watchOut: [
    "SPIFFE says **who a workload is**. It says nothing about which user the workload is acting for. For that you still need a token carrying the user’s delegation, alongside the workload identity.",
    "Authentication is not authorization. Mutual TLS with no policy means every workload in the trust domain can call every other.",
    "X.509-SVIDs rotate automatically. When the agent starts using the new certificate for TLS, it needs a new certificate-bound token. The previous token still requires the previous certificate and key, while the token is valid and the API accepts that certificate.",
    "Registration entries decide which workloads get which IDs. Loose selectors (a whole namespace) hand the same identity to things that should differ.",
    "An LLM agent that spawns sub-agents in one process shares one SVID among them. Workload identity names the workload and nothing inside it.",
    "Anything running in the agent’s container can ask for the agent’s certificate and key, including code the agent was asked to run. Run untrusted code in a separate pod that cannot reach the socket.",
