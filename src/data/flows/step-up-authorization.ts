    "Start with a weak token. When the agent reaches something sensitive, the API says so and the user is asked for exactly that.",
  summary: `Asking for every permission up front is how agents end up holding tokens that can do far more than the task needs. The alternative is to begin with the minimum and let the resource server say when more is required.

Two standards make this workable. The step-up challenge lets an API answer “this token is fine, but not for this: come back with a stronger authentication or a broader scope.” Rich Authorization Requests let the follow-up request describe one specific action in structured detail instead of a coarse scope string. Together they give a pattern where routine work flows without interruption and a human is pulled in only for the moments that matter, to approve something concrete.`,
