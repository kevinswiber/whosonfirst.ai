  summary: `Token exchange works inside one trust domain, where a single authorization server (AS) can mint a token for any hop. Agent workflows do not stay inside one domain. An agent in company A calls a service run by company B. Company B will not accept company A’s tokens, and should not.

Identity chaining combines two existing pieces to cross the boundary. In its home domain, the agent uses token exchange to obtain a short-lived **JWT authorization grant** addressed to the other domain’s authorization server. It then presents that grant to the other side using the JWT bearer grant, and receives an access token that the second domain issued under its own policy. Each domain validates only what it issued or explicitly agreed to trust, and the pattern repeats for every further boundary.

The specification is through IETF approval and waiting in the RFC Editor’s queue.`,

    "Each hop can add or drop claims. Make sure the receiving side does not treat a claim as verified merely because it arrived.",
