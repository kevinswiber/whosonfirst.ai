    "The agent never holds the secret. A proxy outside the sandbox adds it to outgoing requests, and only for the hosts it was meant for.",
  summary: `Every other page on this site is about getting the right credential to an agent. This one is about not giving it one at all.

An agent that executes code, reads web pages and follows instructions found in documents can be manipulated. If it holds an API key, a successful prompt injection can print it, post it, or commit it. Shortening the key’s life and narrowing its scope help. Removing it from the agent’s reach helps more.

In this pattern the agent runs in a sandbox whose only route to the network is a proxy the agent does not control. The real credentials live in a vault beside that proxy. When the agent makes a request to an allowed host, the proxy attaches the credential on the way out. The agent can *use* the access. It cannot *read* it from its own environment, and the proxy will not send it to any other host.

There is no standard for this. It is an architecture, implemented in several managed agent platforms and open-source proxies, and it composes with everything else here.`,

    "It stops exfiltration of the credential, not misuse of the access. A hijacked agent can still make harmful calls to the allowed host while it runs.",
    "The proxy must see inside the request to add a header, so it terminates TLS. That makes it a high-value target and requires the sandbox to trust its certificate authority.",
    "Scope each credential to specific hosts, and prefer a fixed place for it: one named header or one named body field, set by the operator. Never a URL. A proxy that swaps a placeholder wherever the agent wrote it leaves the host list as the only control, and an agent can then write the placeholder into a comment on an allowed API and read the key back in the reply.",
    "The agent cannot read the key from its own environment. It can still obtain one from an allowed host that echoes what it is sent, or that lets a caller create new keys. Check both for every API you add.",

**Sealed secrets.** The agent holds the secret encrypted to the proxy’s key. Only the proxy can open it, and the sealed value carries its own list of permitted hosts.
