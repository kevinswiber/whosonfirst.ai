    "A tool needs the user to sign in somewhere else. It hands back a link, the user completes the flow in a browser, and the secret never touches the agent.",
  summary: `An MCP server often sits in front of someone else’s API. The user has authorized their client to use the MCP server, but the server still needs the user’s permission at the third party: their code host, their CRM, their bank.

The wrong ways to get it are familiar. One is to ask the user to paste an API key into the chat, where the model and every log will see it. The other is to have the client forward its own token, which is token passthrough. URL-mode elicitation is the protocol’s answer: in the middle of a tool call the server replies “I need the user to visit this URL.” The client shows the link, the user opens it in a real browser, and the server completes an ordinary OAuth flow with the third party on its own. The credential is stored by the server and is never seen by the client or the model.

The same mechanism covers anything sensitive that should bypass the agent: entering a key, confirming a payment, approving a specific action on a page the server controls.`,

    "This is **not** how a client gets authorized to the MCP server itself. That is [MCP authorization](/flows/mcp-authorization/); the specification says servers must not use elicitation for it.",
    "Phishing in both directions. A malicious server can send a link to a lookalike sign-in page, so clients must show the full URL and never open it without consent. And the server must make sure the person who completes the flow is the user who started it.",
    "The server becomes a holder of third-party tokens, with everything that implies for storage and revocation.",
    "The feature is still marked as subject to change, and its wire format did change in 2026-07-28. Check client support before depending on it.",
