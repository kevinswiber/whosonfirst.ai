    "One agent discovers another, reads what credentials it wants, and presents them. When the remote agent needs more, it says so mid-task.",
  summary: `The Agent2Agent protocol lets independently built agents hand work to each other. Its position on security is deliberately conservative: an agent is an ordinary enterprise application, and should be authenticated the way web services already are. A2A does not invent a token format or an identity scheme. It defines how a remote agent **declares** what it requires, and leaves obtaining the credential to existing standards.

The declaration lives in the **Agent Card**, a JSON document published at a well-known URL. It lists security schemes in a form borrowed from OpenAPI: API key, HTTP bearer, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or mutual TLS. The calling agent reads the card, gets a matching credential by whatever means apply, and sends it on every request in an HTTP header.

Two parts of version 1.0 matter for trust. Agent Cards can be signed, so a caller can check that a card was issued by who it claims. And there is a defined task state for the moment a remote agent needs further authorization partway through the work.`,

  ],
  watchOut: [
    "A2A carries credentials; it does not define delegation. Whether the remote agent learns which user the task is for depends entirely on the token you send. Use [token exchange](/flows/token-exchange/) so that it does.",
    "An unsigned Agent Card is a claim by whoever answered the URL. A signed one is only as good as your reason to trust the signing key; the protocol defines no trust anchor.",
    "The remote agent is a full autonomous system. Authenticating it tells you who operates it, not what it will do with your data.",
    "In-task authorization happens out of band. The state change is a request, not proof that anything was granted.",
