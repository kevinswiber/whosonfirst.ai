    "The agent asks the authorization server to go and find the user. Approval arrives as a push notification, not a redirect.",
  summary: `An agent has been working for an hour. It reaches a step it is not allowed to take alone: send the payment, merge the change, email the customer. The user is not looking at the agent. There is no browser to redirect.

Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication turns the flow around. The agent calls the authorization server directly and says which user it needs and why. The server contacts that user on a device it already knows, typically a phone, and shows them a message describing the request. When the user approves, the agent receives a token. Nothing is typed, nothing is redirected, and the user can be anywhere.

CIBA came out of the OpenID Foundation’s MODRNA working group, which works on OpenID Connect for mobile network operators. The Foundation’s FAPI working group has profiled it for financial services, in an implementer’s draft. The specification’s own examples include a call-center agent who needs to authenticate a caller and a customer who approves a point-of-sale payment on their own phone. That is the same shape as an AI agent asking its principal for permission.`,

  watchOut: [
    "**Approval fatigue.** An agent that can trigger a push whenever it likes will train its user to tap “approve.” Rate-limit requests and make each one specific.",
    "**What the user approves has to be what the token allows.** The authorization server should build the approval prompt from `authorization_details`, the same structured data that goes into the token: “Pay invoice 1042, $1,250.00, to Acme Ltd”. `binding_message` is free text the agent chose. Use it as a short reference the user can match, never as the only description of the action: an agent that has been talked into something can send an honest-looking sentence beside details that say something else.",
    "The agent chooses whom to ask via `login_hint`. If an attacker can influence that value, they choose who gets prompted. Derive it from the authenticated session, never from model output.",
    "CIBA support is uneven. It is common in financial-grade identity providers and less so elsewhere.",
