    "The agent has a key of its own and signs every request. A server the user chose tells the API who the agent acts for and what they approved.",
  summary: `In most OAuth deployments an agent is a client that someone registered: an identifier one authorization server issued and no other recognizes. That suits software whose APIs are known before it ships. An agent finds its APIs as it works, in organizations where nobody has registered it.

AAuth starts from the other end. It is not an OAuth extension. It is a separate protocol, written by the editor of the OAuth 2.0 specification. Each agent has its own key pair and an identifier that anyone can check, and it signs every request it makes. Every token in the protocol is bound to that key, so none of them is a bearer token. The user is represented by a **person server**, which they choose. It tells an API which person the agent acts for, asks that person when something needs their approval, and issues the token that records the answer.

AAuth is an individual draft in its eleventh revision, which is why this page is rated experimental. An unrelated OAuth draft, titled “AAuth - Agentic Authorization OAuth 2.1 Extension”, goes by the same short name. This page is not about that one.`,

    "Agents that find APIs at runtime, in organizations where they were never registered.",
    "APIs that want to know which person a request is for without keeping a registry of agents or running a sign-in of their own.",
    "People and companies that want one place to see, approve and revoke what their agents do across services.",
    "Prototypes and interoperability tests. Nothing here is settled enough to build a product on.",
  ],
  watchOut: [
    "**It is an individual draft, and it is still being redesigned.** The person token, which every step of this diagram depends on, first appeared in the current revision. That revision also renamed endpoints and removed [claims](/glossary/#claim). The draft lists four implementations and calls each of them exploratory.",
    "**The API never learns which agent is calling.** In the arrangement drawn it sees a person, a scope and a key. No token it reads names the agent or the agent’s provider, and that is deliberate. A rule such as “only agents from this vendor” cannot be enforced here.",
    "**Check the token’s type.** A person token and an auth token from the same person server carry the same issuer, audience, subject and key. Only `typ` tells them apart. An API that skips that check treats “this is Alice’s agent” as “Alice approved this.” The draft says to test for the mistake, because it fails open.",
    "**Any person server can speak to any API.** Nothing is arranged between them beforehand. A person token shows that the same person is back, under the same issuer and subject. It does not show who they are, or that anyone checked. Key your records on issuer and subject together, and decide what a newcomer may do.",
    "**The agent writes its own justification**, and the user reads it when deciding. The person server has to show it as the agent’s claim, apart from the API’s own description of the access. An agent that has been talked into something will still give a reasonable-sounding reason.",
    "**The signature covers less than it seems.** On a call to an API it covers, by default, the method, the host, the path and the token presented. The query string and the body are covered only if the API says they must be. Requests that carry a body to a person server or an access server, and requests to revoke a token, are stricter: the signature must also cover a digest of the body and its content type.",

      title: "How this differs from OAuth",
      body: `**No registration.** An OAuth client is known where it was registered or, with a Client ID Metadata Document, where its URL is accepted. An AAuth agent can be checked by anyone who can fetch its provider’s keys.

**No bearer tokens.** In OAuth, binding a token to a key is an addition: [DPoP](/flows/dpop/) or mutual TLS. Here every token is bound to the agent’s key and every request is signed.

**No authorization code.** Nothing of value returns through the browser. The agent collects the token by polling, on a signed request.

**The user’s server, not the API’s.** In OAuth the authorization server belongs with the API, and the user has an account there. In the arrangement drawn, consent is collected by a server the user chose, which the API may never have heard of.`,
    },
    {
      title: "What is not drawn",
      body: `Most of the draft is outside this diagram.

**Missions.** The agent proposes a description of a whole task, and the user approves it at the person server. After that, the person server judges each request the agent brings it under the mission against that description and against what came before, and keeps a log of those requests. It does not see every call. Once an auth token is issued, the agent calls the API directly until the token expires, and it is the API that enforces what the token grants. An agent can also report to the person server what it did. That report is optional.

**Access servers.** An API that wants a policy engine of its own names one in the resource token, and the person server obtains the auth token there.

**Chains.** An API that calls another API acts as an agent in its turn, and presents the token it received as evidence of whom it is acting for. The draft deliberately puts no delegation chain in any token, which is the opposite choice to [token exchange](/flows/token-exchange/).

Companion drafts cover how an agent enrolls with its provider, authorization described in an API’s own vocabulary, and event delivery.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Where it stands",
      body: `Both documents the diagram depends on are individual drafts: the protocol at revision -11 and HTTP Signature Keys at -09, each dated September 2026. A call for the HTTP working group to adopt the second ended in September 2026. The datatracker records: “WG doesn’t have consensus to adopt at this time.” The protocol’s author says AAuth has been adopted as a working group at the OpenID Foundation, and that specification work will migrate there.

Read it, and prototype with it. For something further along: [MCP authorization](/flows/mcp-authorization/) does without registration, [DPoP](/flows/dpop/) binds a token to a key, and [CIBA](/flows/ciba/) reaches a user who is somewhere else.`,
