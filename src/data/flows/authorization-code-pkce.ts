Three of its changes touch this page. A token request no longer carries \`redirect_uri\`, the PKCE \`plain\` method is removed, and the authorization server must send \`iss\` in its response. This page shows the published RFCs, so step 7 still sends \`redirect_uri\`, and step 6 and the part on hosted apps allow for a server that sends no \`iss\`. A flow built on the draft, such as [MCP authorization](/flows/mcp-authorization/), leaves \`redirect_uri\` out.`,
