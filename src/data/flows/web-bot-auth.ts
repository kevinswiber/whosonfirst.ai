  tagline:
    "An agent that browses the open web signs its requests, so a site can tell which operator it belongs to without trusting a user-agent string.",
  summary: `Most of this site is about agents calling APIs that expect them. Agents also browse ordinary websites, which were built for people and regard automated traffic with suspicion. Sites have had two bad options for telling good bots from bad: the \`User-Agent\` header, which anyone can type, and lists of IP addresses, which break whenever infrastructure moves and say nothing about shared platforms.

Web Bot Auth replaces both with cryptography. The agent’s operator publishes its public keys at an HTTPS URL. The agent signs each request using HTTP Message Signatures and names that URL in a header. The website, or more usually the CDN in front of it, fetches the keys, verifies the signature, and then applies whatever policy it likes to a caller it can now name.

This is identification, not authorization. A valid signature says that a holder of a key published at that URL signed the parts of the request the signature covers. It does not say a user asked for the request or that the site must serve it.`,

  ],
  watchOut: [
    "It identifies the **operator**, not the end user and not the individual agent run. Per-user authorization still needs a login or a token.",
    "The identity is only as meaningful as the site’s policy for it. Verification proves a name; reputation is a separate matter.",
    "The specification is an early working group draft. Between revisions the header’s syntax has changed, and so has what its value points to: an origin in earlier drafts, the key directory’s own URL in this one. Deployed verifiers may expect an older form.",
    "The signature covers selected parts of the request. Know which. One that covers only the site’s name can be reused by anyone who sees it, for any method and path on that site, until it expires. Do not assume the body is protected.",
