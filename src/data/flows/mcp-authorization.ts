    "How an MCP client that has never seen a server before discovers where to sign in, identifies itself, and gets a token good for that server alone.",
  summary: `The Model Context Protocol has a problem classic OAuth never had to solve: any client may meet any server, with no prior arrangement. A user pastes in a server URL, and the client has to work out which authorization server protects it, introduce itself to that server, and obtain a token, all at runtime.

MCP answers this with a profile of OAuth 2.1 plus three discovery steps. The MCP server is an OAuth **resource server**. It points to its authorization server through protected resource metadata. The client identifies itself with a URL that the authorization server can fetch, called a Client ID Metadata Document, instead of registering in advance. Every token request names one MCP server through the \`resource\` parameter.

This page describes the **2026-07-28** revision of the specification. Authorization is optional in MCP and applies to HTTP transports; a server launched over stdio takes its credentials from its environment.`,

    "Every URL in the discovery steps comes from a server the client has never seen. A client that runs on your servers should refuse any that are not HTTPS or that resolve to private, loopback or link-local addresses, including after a redirect. Before opening the authorization endpoint, check that it is an `https:` URL, and hand it to the browser without passing it through a shell.",
    "Client credentials must be stored per issuer and never reused with a different authorization server. A server that changes its metadata to point somewhere new is the start of a mix-up attack.",
    "A Client ID Metadata Document proves control of a URL, not that the software on the user’s machine is the genuine client. Authorization servers must show the redirect host on the consent screen for this reason.",

**A key for each user, pasted into the client’s configuration**, does identify the user. But it is long-lived, it is often good for everything that user can do, and the user has to copy it by hand into a file on a machine you do not control.

An access token from this flow is short-lived, as short as the authorization server is set to make it. It carries only the scopes the user approved and, where the authorization server honors the \`resource\` parameter, it is issued for your server alone.

The client may still hold a refresh token on that machine. The difference is that it belongs to one client, can be replaced and revoked for that client alone, and the user never sees or pastes it.`,

[Lesson 2](/learn/tokens/) takes those checks one at a time. If the tokens are JWTs, a library does the cryptography, with the public keys your authorization server publishes at the address its metadata gives. If they are opaque, your server asks the authorization server what each one stands for. Either way, the audience and scope checks are the part to get right. A valid token still leaves the server to decide whether to run this tool with these arguments. [Tool-call authorization](/flows/tool-call-authorization/) shows one way to make that decision.`,

Otherwise the provider’s remembered consent lets an attacker’s client collect a code the user never approved.

If your server has to call something else for the user, it gets a token of its own: by [token exchange](/flows/token-exchange/) where both sit under one authorization server, or by sending the user to connect that account directly, which is [URL elicitation](/flows/url-elicitation/).`,
