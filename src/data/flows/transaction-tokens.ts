  tagline:
    "Inside your own infrastructure, replace the access token with a short-lived token that pins down one transaction and travels the whole call chain.",
  summary: `A request arrives at your edge with an access token. Behind the edge are an agent, the tools it calls, and the services those tools call. If the access token is passed along, every one of those services holds a credential that works at the front door. If each hop calls the others with only its own service identity, the downstream services have no idea who the request is for.

A transaction token sits between those two failures. At the edge, the external token is exchanged for a signed, short-lived token that records who the request is for, which workload asked, and the fixed details of what was requested. That token is passed unchanged from service to service inside one trust domain. Services can read it and make decisions on it, but they cannot alter the context, and the token is not valid outside that trust domain.

For agent systems this is a way to keep the user’s intent attached to a request as an LLM fans it out across tools, without giving the agent or its tools the access token. What they hold instead covers one transaction and expires within minutes.`,

    "Multi-service backends where an agent’s tool calls fan out through several internal hops.",
    "You need every hop to know the original user and request, and to be unable to change them.",

  ],
  watchOut: [
    "Transaction tokens do not authenticate the hop. Pair them with workload identity (mutual TLS or workload tokens) so each service knows which peer is calling.",
    "They are for use **inside** a trust domain. Crossing to another domain is a job for [identity chaining](/flows/identity-chaining/).",
    "The transaction token service becomes critical infrastructure: every request depends on it, and it must be told the truth about request context.",
    "How agent-specific context should be represented is still being worked out in individual drafts.",
