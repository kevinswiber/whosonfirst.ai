    "The company identity provider decides which agents may reach which apps for which employees. No per-app consent screens.",
  summary: `Inside a company, per-user consent is the wrong control. An employee clicking “Allow” twenty times does not give the security team visibility into which AI tools are connected to which systems, and the employee is not the one who should be deciding.

The Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant, or ID-JAG, moves the decision to the identity provider (IdP) the company already uses for single sign-on. The agent signs the user in once. When it needs access to another application, it asks the identity provider for a short-lived assertion aimed at that application’s authorization server, which the draft calls the resource authorization server (resource AS). The identity provider applies administrator policy and either issues it or refuses. The agent trades the assertion for an ordinary access token.

No browser redirect, no consent prompt, and one place where access is granted and logged, and where new access is cut off. The draft calls the pattern Cross-App Access (XAA), the name it goes by among vendors. In MCP it is the official **Enterprise-Managed Authorization** extension.`,

    "It only works when both sides are connected to the same identity provider. The MCP extension is written for enterprise deployments. The draft is not limited to them: it says the same pattern can arise with customer and platform identity providers.",
    "The identity provider sees and controls token issuance. It does not see what the agent then does with the token.",
    "The underlying IETF specification is still a working group draft, and the MCP extension pins a specific revision. Expect changes.",
    "Support is uneven on both ends: the identity provider must issue ID-JAGs and each application’s authorization server must accept them.",
