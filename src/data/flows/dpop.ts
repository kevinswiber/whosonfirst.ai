    "Bind a token to a key so that stealing the token is not enough to use it.",
  summary: `A bearer token works like cash: whoever holds it can spend it. That was an acceptable trade when tokens lived in a server’s memory. Agents put tokens in riskier places. They pass through tool calls, logs, traces, proxies and sometimes the model’s own context, and an agent that reads untrusted content can be talked into revealing what it holds.

Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) fixes the cash problem at the application layer. The agent generates a key pair, and the authorization server binds each token to the public key. Every request then carries a small signed proof made with the private key. A stolen token without the key is rejected.

Mutual TLS does the same job at the transport layer and is a good fit where a service mesh or workload identity system already manages certificates. DPoP works where the agent cannot control TLS: public clients, desktop apps, anything behind a proxy that terminates connections.`,
  fits: [
    "Any flow on this site that ends with an access token. DPoP is an add-on, not a grant type.",
    "Public clients (desktop, CLI, mobile) that cannot hold a client secret but can hold a key.",
    "Refresh tokens held by public clients, such as desktop and CLI agents. A confidential client’s refresh token is tied to its own credentials, not to the DPoP key.",
  ],
  watchOut: [
    "DPoP protects the token, not the key. If the private key sits in the same file as the token, the thief takes both. Use a platform keystore or non-exportable key where one exists.",
    "It does not stop a compromised agent from *using* its own key. It stops a token from being useful somewhere else.",
    "Both the authorization server and the resource server must support it. A resource server that ignores the binding and accepts the token as a plain bearer token has gained nothing.",
    "Keep the signing operation away from the model, not only the key. An agent that can be talked into signing can make proofs in advance for someone else to use. A nonce from the server limits how far ahead a proof can be made.",
    "Proofs are tied to method and URL, and servers may require a nonce. Clock skew and proxies that rewrite URLs are the usual sources of trouble.",
