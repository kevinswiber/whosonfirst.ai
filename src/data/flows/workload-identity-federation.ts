    "Your agent uses an identity established by its runtime to obtain short-lived access from a system that trusts that identity.",
  summary: `The place an agent runs already knows which workload it started. Cloud services, virtual machines, containers, CI jobs and on-premises infrastructure can all turn that knowledge into an identity the workload can prove. Kubernetes service account tokens are one implementation, worked through [further down](#example).

Two related ideas are involved, and they are not interchangeable. **Platform-provided workload identity** means the infrastructure establishes the workload’s identity and supplies its credentials, so the application owner does not provision a long-lived application secret. **Workload identity federation** means a receiving system trusts an identity established in another trust domain and uses it to grant access.

A Lambda function calling AWS APIs with its execution role is using native workload identity: one identity system, and nothing is federated. Using that function’s identity to obtain access in a different identity system is federation. The other system does not have to belong to another cloud provider. A Kubernetes cluster and the cloud it runs in are separate trust domains, and so are a CI service and the account it deploys to.

What the pattern removes is the need to provision and manage a long-lived application secret, for the integrations that support it. It does not remove credentials. The identity credential and whatever is issued in exchange are short-lived, and they still need protecting. The destination also has to support the trust arrangement: an API that only accepts an API key cannot be federated to, and a [credential broker](/flows/credential-broker/) is the usual answer there.`,

  ],
  watchOut: [
    "**Trust a specific issuer, and know who else it serves.** Some issuers sign for many tenants under one URL. GitHub Actions on GitHub.com uses a single issuer for every repository, so trusting the issuer alone trusts all of them.",
    "**Require the audience you intended.** The identity credential should name the receiving token service, and the receiver should refuse any other value. A credential issued for one recipient and accepted by another is a confused-deputy path.",
    "**Match the exact workload.** Pin the subject, or the claims that stand in for it, to one workload: one service account, one repository and environment, one role. Avoid wildcards and prefix matches, and prefer identifiers that cannot be reassigned, such as IDs over names where the issuer offers them. What a rule can match on differs by receiver.",
    "**Grant the least access that works.** The role or permission behind the trust rule is what a stolen credential is worth.",
    "**Do not share one identity between agents.** Agents that share a service account, a role or a job identity are one principal to every system downstream. They cannot be limited, audited or cut off separately.",
    "**Short-lived credentials still need protecting.** A bearer token, such as a JWT identity credential or an access token issued for it, can be replayed by whoever holds a copy until it expires. Certificate-based authentication is different: it requires proof of possession of the matching private key, so the key is what has to stay private. Keep tokens and private keys out of logs, prompts and tool output. Limit what can reach the platform’s credential endpoints too: anything that can make requests from inside the workload, including a tool the agent was talked into calling, may be able to ask for the same credentials.",
    "**Deleting the workload does not cut off its credentials.** It stops the platform issuing or renewing the identity credential. A copy that has not expired can still be exchanged for new access while the receiver’s trust rule stands, and what the receiver already issued has a lifetime of its own. See the note on stopping access.",
    "**The receiver has to reach the issuer’s keys.** A private cluster or an internal identity provider has to publish its discovery document and keys somewhere the receiver can fetch them, or upload the keys where the receiver allows that.",
    "**Workload identity is not a user’s authority.** Federation establishes which workload is calling. It does not carry a person’s identity or consent, and it does not turn the agent’s access into the user’s. Carrying a user’s authority is delegation: see [token exchange](/flows/token-exchange/).",

    {
      title: "What the platform and the SDK do for you",
      body: `In most deployments you write none of the eight steps. The platform issues the identity credential and keeps it fresh. A cloud SDK or credential library, pointed at that credential, makes the exchange, caches what comes back, renews it, and attaches it to requests or signs them. The receiving system does the validation. What is left to you is configuration: which identity the workload runs as, the trust rule on the receiving side, and the access behind it.

With native workload identity there is less still. A function, virtual machine or managed container calling its own cloud’s APIs is handed credentials for that cloud’s identity system by the platform, and nothing is exchanged. Federation starts when the system being called is not the one that established the identity.`,
    },
    {
      title: "One exchange, several request formats",
      body: `No single specification defines this pattern. What the implementations share is a signed identity credential, usually a JWT, and a published way to find the issuer’s keys, usually OpenID Connect discovery. The exchange itself is where they differ.

**Google Cloud** follows OAuth token exchange (RFC 8693). The workload posts its credential to the Security Token Service as the subject token and receives a federated access token. The service also accepts proofs that are not JWTs, including a signed AWS request and an X.509 client certificate presented over mutual TLS.

**Microsoft Entra** uses the client credentials grant. The outside token goes in \`client_assertion\`, with \`client_assertion_type\` set to the JWT bearer type from RFC 7523, in place of an assertion the application would otherwise sign with its own certificate. Its issuer, subject and audience must match the federated identity credential exactly. A [flexible federated identity credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identities-flexible-federated-identity-credentials), which Microsoft marks as a preview, replaces the fixed subject with an expression over the token’s claims that can use wildcards. It is supported for tokens issued by GitHub, GitLab and Terraform Cloud.

**AWS, inbound.** \`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\` takes the token and the role to assume. The call is not signed with AWS credentials. It returns temporary security credentials for signing requests, not an OAuth access token.

**AWS, outbound.** A workload that already has AWS credentials can call \`GetWebIdentityToken\` for a short-lived JWT to present to a service outside AWS. The feature has to be enabled for the account first, and the caller needs permission for the operation. The caller names the audience and the signing algorithm. The token lasts from one minute to an hour, five minutes by default. The issuer URL is specific to the account, and the operation is not available on the STS global endpoint. AWS describes the token as proof of identity, to be exchanged at the outside service for that service’s own credentials.

Audience values, credential lifetimes, the claims a rule can match on and the way keys are discovered are each provider’s own. Do not carry one provider’s settings over to another.

**A proposed common request.** The [Workload Authorization Grant](/standards/#wag) proposes one request for a receiver that is an OAuth authorization server, such as a third-party service’s. The credential goes in \`assertion\` on a JWT bearer grant (RFC 7523), and the draft recommends naming the API in \`resource\`. The credential’s audience is the authorization server’s issuer identifier. No client authentication is required, and no refresh token is issued. It is an individual draft, not adopted by a working group, and any part of it may change.

Its trust rule names the platform, not the workload. The authorization server is set up once to trust the platform’s issuer, and then accepts agents it has not seen before, so the platform decides which agents exist. Where one issuer signs for several customers, the rule also names a claim and the value that sets this customer apart, and an assertion without that value does not match. What each agent may do comes from the server’s own policy, which can read claims the platform includes, such as a team or a role. A claim means what that platform means by it: the draft says not to read a claim of the same name from another platform as the same thing. The server keeps each agent’s records under the trust rule it matched and its subject together, never under the subject alone, and a display name the platform sends must never decide access. Whether to require proof of possession is still open in the draft.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Stopping access",
      body: `Cutting off a workload is three separate events. Each has its own control, and none of them brings about the others.

**The platform stops issuing or renewing the identity credential.** Deleting the workload or disabling its platform identity does this. It does not recall a credential already handed out. A copy that has not expired is still a validly signed statement.

**The receiving system stops accepting that credential in new exchanges.** A receiver that validates a JWT offline, against cached keys, sees a valid signature and an unexpired token. It cannot see that the pod, service account or job behind the token is gone. So a copied token can go on obtaining new downstream credentials after its workload is deleted, for as long as it is unexpired and the trust rule is in place. Removing or narrowing the trust rule is what stops further exchanges, once that change has taken effect.

**Downstream credentials already issued are invalidated.** These have their own validity and their own revocation rules, set by the receiver. Removing the trust rule does not recall them. Some receivers can cut them short: AWS can revoke the sessions a role issued before a given time, by attaching a policy that denies them. Some cannot: Azure says a managed identity’s token cannot be forced to refresh before it expires, and that changes to the identity’s group or role membership can take several hours to apply. The [access revocation flow](/flows/access-revocation/) shows what it takes for an API to enforce a change before a token expires.

Short lifetimes on both credentials keep the gaps small. Deleting a pod, a service account or a job is not an instant cut-off, and neither is deleting a trust rule.`,

  illustrated: {
    steps: `The diagram shows a common JWT-based federation flow using OIDC discovery. Other implementations use different proofs and verification mechanisms, such as an X.509 certificate presented over mutual TLS, a signed request, or keys an administrator uploads.

    references: `These are required by the flow the diagram draws: a JWT identity credential, and OIDC discovery to find the keys that verify it. Neither is required of every implementation of workload identity federation, and each can be replaced separately. A certificate or a signed request can take the place of the JWT.

A receiver outside the cluster that validates the signature offline checks none of this. A token whose pod is gone still verifies until it expires. Kubernetes says a client that needs the binding checked must present the token to the API server through the TokenReview API.

A custom API, a gateway or an on-premises service validates it against Google’s public discovery and key endpoints, checking issuer, signature, audience and expiry. The service then authorizes the verified identity. Google’s example compares the subject against an allowlist of agent SPIFFE IDs.

The service accepts the identity token directly, as a bearer token on the request. Nothing is exchanged. Google documents the exchange path separately, for receivers with built-in federation such as Microsoft Entra, so not every integration needs a second token. By default the token is also bound to the agent’s certificate. A receiver can enforce that binding over mutual TLS. One that ignores it is accepting a bearer token.

Google marks this feature Preview, under pre-GA terms and with limited support. That is the product’s release stage. It is separate from the maturity of the standards underneath, JWT and OpenID Connect Discovery, which are stable.`,

The first covers authentication. With workload identity federation, a workload outside Azure presents a token from its own identity provider and receives a Microsoft Entra access token, with no client secret or certificate of its own.

The second covers authorization. The designer of a custom API defines application roles on the API’s registration, and an administrator assigns them to the workload. The receiving API validates the access token and checks its \`roles\` claim for the operation being called. Microsoft says an API does not use the scope claim for workloads, and that the API is responsible for enforcing the workload’s access. By default an application role covers every instance of a resource, so anything finer is the API’s own policy.`,

**DynamoDB.** The agent passes the user’s Cognito ID token to \`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\`. Session tags taken from the signed token, and an IAM policy that keys on them, limit the temporary credentials to the user’s department. IAM refuses a request outside it.

**Salesforce.** AgentCore Identity performs an on-behalf-of token exchange (RFC 8693) and obtains a user-scoped token. Salesforce’s own sharing rules decide what that user sees.

**Knowledge Bases.** The agent adds a metadata filter to its query. AWS calls this application-layer enforcement: it holds only while the agent’s code applies the filter, unlike the DynamoDB restriction, which IAM enforces. For stricter isolation AWS suggests a knowledge base for each department, with IAM policies on each.

Access delegated by a user is the subject of [token exchange](/flows/token-exchange/).`,
