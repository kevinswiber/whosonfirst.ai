    "A workload identity that is bound to a key and proven on every request, so it survives the gateways and proxies that agent traffic passes through.",
  summary: `Mutual TLS gives two workloads strong mutual authentication, until something in the middle terminates the connection. Agent traffic passes through a lot of middle: API gateways, MCP gateways, service-mesh waypoints, inspection proxies. Each one ends the TLS session, and the caller’s certificate goes no further. The usual fallback is a bearer JWT in a header, which anyone along the path can copy and replay.

The IETF WIMSE working group is standardizing a credential built for this. A **Workload Identity Token** (WIT) is a JWT that names the workload and carries its public key. It is never accepted on its own. Each request must also carry proof that the sender holds the matching private key: either a **Workload Proof Token** (WPT), a small signed JWT bound to this request, or an HTTP Message Signature over the request itself. A proxy can forward both, and a thief who copies them has at most a proof for one URL that expires within minutes.

The working group’s agent architecture document says plainly that agents are workloads, and builds on exactly this.`,

    "As with any workload identity, this identifies the software, not the user it is working for. Carry the user’s delegation separately, in a header field of its own: a request that presents a proof token cannot also present a bearer token.",
