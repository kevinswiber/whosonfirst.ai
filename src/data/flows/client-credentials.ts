    "The agent authenticates as itself. No user, no consent screen, no one to ask.",
  summary: `When an agent runs on a schedule, reacts to an event, or does work that belongs to an organization rather than a person, there is no user to redirect. The agent is the principal. It proves its own identity to the authorization server and receives a token whose subject is the agent.

The grant is trivial. The hard part is the credential the agent uses to authenticate. A static client secret in an environment variable is a long-lived password that never gets rotated and leaks into logs, images and model context. A signed assertion from a key the agent holds is better. A platform-issued workload identity the agent never has to store is better still.`,
  fits: [
    "No user is involved: batch jobs, monitors, scheduled research, back-office automation.",
    "The agent acts with its **own** permissions, which an administrator granted in advance.",
    "Both sides belong to the same organization, or have a pre-arranged trust relationship.",
  ],
  watchOut: [
    "An agent that serves many users with one service identity is a confused deputy waiting to happen. If user A can talk the agent into fetching user B’s data, the API cannot stop it: the token says “agent,” not “user A.”",
    "Client secrets are the most common credential found in agent prompts, traces and repositories. Prefer `private_key_jwt` or [workload identity federation](/flows/workload-identity-federation/).",
    "There is no consent step, so scopes are whatever an admin configured. Review them as you would a service account’s IAM role.",
    "No refresh token is issued; the agent just asks again. Keep access tokens short-lived so revoking the client takes effect quickly.",
